the k2vr team and project originally started out as kinecttovr it was an opensource application created by sharkyh20 for kinect and psmove full body tracking it was made as a sort of response to the alternatives being paid because of real life obligations sharky stepped away from the project leaving it unattended for a long time for some reason i aurora picked up the project and chose to start giving users support for it eventually writing a crude installer meeting up with akaya who at the time had forked the kinecttovr codebase and was intending on using it for an arduino vr glove project akaya's efforts in fixing up kinecttovr for their usecase led to a new version of the app since we didn't have a definitive answer on whether sharky would pick the project back up at the time we named this version of the app kinecttovr ex or k2ex for short the ex was meant to stand for extra or extended because it added features to the original work of sharky years have passed and an official website custom graphical installer multiple large scale yearly updates and thousands of users later we've arrived at present day what is amethyst amethyst is a modular platform with support for device plugins that you can write yourself if you know c by default it comes with device plugins for xbox 360 kinect xbox one kinect psmoveservice ex and owotrack it's pretty much a complete departure from the original kinecttovr app for almost as long as k2ex has been a thing akaya has worked on a now defunct rewrite of the app using qt as a side project with the intent of having it replace the main app eventually a lot of the work from this rewrite wasn't in vain though from it was created k2api which provides the necessary interfaces for any application to communicate with the steamvr driver and a lot of boilerplate code for handling kinect after multiple roadblocks were brought up by qt akaya canned it and started working on a super secret ktvr rewrite using microsoft's winui 3 for the interface originally titled kinecttovr 1 0 it was given the codename amethyst i came up with that name in about 30 seconds it was only meant to be a codename for us to refer to the app internally without getting confused it eventually dawned on me that considering the small jump in version numbers only from 0 9 to 1 0 users might not catch on to the fact that this is an entirely new app and so the name amethyst was given to the whole winui 3 project and it was given a shiny new coat of paint on the dots logo it also turns out that people don't tend to misspell amethyst as much as they do kinecttovr where are we now now the app is called amethyst it's created by k2vr team and support for it is given on the k2vr community discord server the application and it's documentation are hosted on the k2vr tech website the application used to install amethyst is called amethyst installer so tl dr when you talk about the app amethyst when you talk aboutt he project k2vr who is that girl that's violet the mascot for k2vr and amethyst because amethyst is a body tracking application it made sense for us to have a mascot to help us create tracking demos in a way that's consistent with the rest of branding you can find her doing some sick tricks on the website's homepage greeting you in the amethyst installer and in the first time setup wizard she's also in the calibration window to show you a direct visual guide on how to move about your room and she's our discord support chatbot why maintain kinect full body isn't it a dead end technology i can see why one would think that but the reality is that over the years with different ideas innovations and such we've been able to push so much out of this aging hardware and it gets a ton of existing silicon a new lease on life and makes people happy i won't hide that it often hurts having to deal with the outdated drivers for kinect they're very buggy and the source of most of our users' problems but when people come in the server and tell us just how much fun they had with their kinect it makes it all worth it having body tracking in vr is one of the most immersion fullfilling experiences and we get to provide it free or almost free of charge to anyone kinect is already way better than a 30 dollar sensor from 2010 has any right to be and we're not done because nothing is confirmed yet i won't reveal potential future plans but expect some really cool stuff from the team do you take donations yes right here on our opencollective page you can either make a monthly or one time donation money will go to domain and hosting costs buying missing hardware for team members to test faster and compensating everyone's volunteer work they've done for years donators will be given a permanent role on the discord and have their name listed in the app's credits page you can choose not to if you wish to keep anonymity"},{"title":"Installing Amethyst","path":"en/app/installation","plaintext":"installing amethyst"},{"title":"Getting a Kinect and adapter","path":"en/buying-kinect","plaintext":"getting a kinect and adapter when using amethyst you're most likely going to use a kinect other devices are supported but 99 of users are interested in using the app for kinect body tracking if you came here it's because you don't already have a kinect and want to know where and what to buy there's a few recommendations and some huge do nots that you should follow it's easy to end up overpaying or buying broken hardware should you even get a kinect there's other options out there slimevr apriltag vive trackers obviously ps move too kinect is cheap but it has limitations that might make you want to reconsider sideways tracking is almost inexistent any poses that involve your head being lower than your waist e g handstands breakdancing carthweels backflips can't be done joint rotation is far from perfect nuless you provide external data from comaptible devices and most of all you need a really large room with xbox 360 kinect you need to stand at least 1 5 meters away from it for tracking to work and preferably 2 meters for the best tracking with xbox one kinect it's more around 1 2 meters minimum and 1 8 preferably you also need to put the kinect where it can see you at eye level and connect to your pc the cable is about 3 meters 9 feet and the adapter adds another 30cm 1 foot and if that wasn't funny enough the kinect especially the xbox one kinect is very demanding when it comes to usb bandwidth generally if you have an amd ryzen computer you're almost guaranteed to be fine laptops and quest 2 with oculus link are notable things that can cause issues if you're unsure i would recommend joining the discord and asking us for advice there which kinect should you get in most cases the answer will be to get an xbox 360 kinect for reasons detailed on this page the xbox one kinect costs a lot more over the xbox 360 and apart from a larger field of view smaller minimum required distance for tracking and a 1080p color camera it doesn't actually track you any better or faster than the xbox 360 kinect it also suffers from a lot of issues with usb 3 0 bandwidth and chipset compatibility and breaks tracking on headsets and controllers using base stations e g vive index pimax if you have a smaller room and can only stand about 1 5 meters away and you've ensured that you have the usb bandwidth to run the xbox one kinect then you might consider it but otherwise just don't where do i buy the kinect if you're in the uk go here don't even ask any questions kinects sold at cex always work the adapters are tested and there's a warranty it's price is also unbeatable it also means you get to ignore the entire part about adapters further down this page elsewhere check either ebay or local classified ads websites any kinect you'll find on amazon is probably overpriced if you search for common mispellings of kinect like xbox connect konect kinnect or similar you'll often find listings from people that lack education on both spelling and money where do i get the adapter get it on ebay please we have it on good authority that every user who got shipped a dead adapter had purchased it on amazon i know that some people may be reticent to use ebay because of past experiences but we've had only good feedback from people using ebay on our discord depending on where you live the link for ebay will change but just open the homepage and search kinect 360 adapter and pick the first or second listing whichever has cheaper shipping or if you wanna get it faster buy it from a seller in your country once the stuff arrives go to either setting up your xbox 360 kinect or setting up your xbox one kinect depending on the kinect you got"},{"title":"How Amethyst compares to other options","path":"en/comparison","plaintext":"how amethyst compares to other options hurr durr cool comparison shit idk dont have stuff for it
