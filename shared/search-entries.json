major role in the confidence of the skeleton tracking sdk more on this subject here kinect placement the kinect should be at the edge of where you're going to play in vr so that you can be facing it a minimum distance of 1 5 meters 5 feet is required for tracking to function but you should be able to stand about 2 meters 6 5 feet away for the best experience height wise put the kinect at around eye

K2VR","path":"en/about","plaintext":"about amethyst and k2vr the story the k2vr team and project originally started out as kinecttovr it was an opensource application created by sharkyh20 for kinect and psmove full body tracking it was made as a sort of response to the alternatives being paid because of real life obligations sharky stepped away from the project leaving it unattended for a long time for some reason i aurora picked up the project and chose to start giving users support for it eventually writing a crude installer meeting up with akaya who at the time had forked the kinecttovr codebase and was intending on using it for an arduino vr glove project akaya's efforts in fixing up kinecttovr for their usecase led to a new version of the app since we didn't have a definitive answer on whether sharky would pick the project back up at the time we named this version of the app kinecttovr ex or k2ex for short the ex was meant to stand for extra or extended because it added features to the original work of sharky years have passed and an official website custom graphical installer multiple large scale yearly updates and thousands of users later we've arrived at present day what is amethyst amethyst is a modular platform with support for device plugins that you can write yourself if you know c by default it comes with device plugins for xbox 360 kinect xbox one kinect psmoveservice ex and owotrack it's pretty much a complete departure from the original kinecttovr app for almost as long as k2ex has been a thing akaya has worked on a now defunct rewrite of the app using qt as a side project with the intent of having it replace the main app eventually a lot of the work from this rewrite wasn't in vain though from it was created k2api which provides the necessary interfaces for any application to communicate with the steamvr driver and a lot of boilerplate code for handling kinect after multiple roadblocks were brought up by qt akaya canned it and started working on a super secret ktvr rewrite using microsoft's winui 3 for the interface originally titled kinecttovr 1 0 it was given the codename amethyst i came up with that name in about 30 seconds it was only meant to be a codename for us to refer to the app internally without getting confused it eventually dawned on me that considering the small jump in version numbers only from 0 9 to 1 0 users might not catch on to the fact that this is an entirely new app and so the name amethyst was given to the whole winui 3 project and it was given a shiny new coat of paint on the dots logo it also turns out that people don't tend to misspell amethyst as much as they do kinecttovr where are we now now the app is called amethyst it's created by k2vr team and support for it is given on the k2vr community discord server the application and it's documentation are hosted on the k2vr tech website the application used to install amethyst is called amethyst installer so tl dr when you talk about the app amethyst when you talk about the project k2vr who is that girl that's violet the mascot for k2vr and amethyst because amethyst is a body tracking application it made sense for us to have a mascot to help us create tracking demos in a way that's consistent with the rest of branding you can find her doing some sick tricks on the website's homepage greeting you in the amethyst installer and in the first time setup wizard she's also in the calibration window to show you a direct visual guide on how to move about your room and she's our discord support chatbot why maintain kinect full body isn't it a dead end technology i can see why one would think that but the reality is that over the years with different ideas innovations and such we've been able to push so much out of this aging hardware and it gets a ton of existing silicon a new lease on life and makes people happy i won't hide that it often hurts having to deal with the outdated drivers for kinect they're very buggy and the source of most of our users' problems but when people come in the server and tell us just how much fun they had with their kinect it makes it all worth it having body tracking in vr is one of the most immersion fullfilling experiences and we get to provide it free or almost free of charge to anyone kinect is already way better than a 30 dollar sensor from 2010 has any right to be and we're not done because nothing is confirmed yet i won't reveal potential future plans but expect some really cool stuff from the team do you take donations yes right here on our opencollective page you can either make a monthly or one time donation money will go to domain and hosting costs buying missing hardware for team members to test faster and compensating everyone's volunteer work they've done for years donators will be given a permanent role on the discord and have their name listed in the app's credits page you can choose not to if you wish to keep anonymity"},{"title":"About the transition to Amethyst","path":"en/amethyst-transition","plaintext":"about the transition to amethyst an introduction it's been two years since we last updated k2ex since then we've been working on a new app named amethyst because it's so old and amethyst fixes basically every issue with it we want to get everyone transitioned over k2ex was built on the original codebase of kinecttovr while we spent a long time fixing bugs and improving it at their core kinecttovr and k2ex were built on a hardcoded shell with a lot of dependencies on libraries we didn't wish to continue using like sfml and boost amethyst is built with all the latest technologies a fancy new user interface and everything we've learned from the past it's made to be stable reliable and modular both in code and for the user you can extend its device support and functionality with your own plugins what to expect comparison of k2ex and amethyst if you've used k2ex in the past amethyst should be a piece of cake for you we took in the feedback of every k2ex user and took it into consideration when designing the user experience if you're a new user we hope it can be just as simple with all the new onboarding and in app instructions functionality wise amethyst works similarly to k2ex it does try to automate as many things as possible and it tries hold your hand when possible the biggest changes are in stability and features amethyst adds support for things like owotrack external tracker based flip new orientation modes for xbox one kinect users finally 🥳 and the ability to spawn a lot more trackers than the 3 supported in k2ex join the discord please amethyst may be near ready for release but we would still prefer if you either join the discord beforehand or see it as the first resource to go to the second

playspace is separate from in game full body tracking calibration in games like vrchat or neosvr for vrchat either refer to the official documentation or simply line up the spheres and press both triggers calibrating amethyst after connecting the trackers to steamvr and making sure your device's tracking is in order click on the begin calibration button located in the general page of the app this will open a panel for you to choose your calibration mode amethyst comes with two calibration modes automatic and manual depending on the device it is possible that only manual calibration will be available for example if calibrating psmoveserviceex calibration serves to line up the amethyst tracking space with that of your vr headset it's unrelated to improving the tracking quality from your device check this page for more information on improving your tracking quality automatic calibration this mode involves calculating the offset between the amethyst and the steamvr playspaces based on the alignment of the skeleton tracking's head bone and your vr headset then the calibration points are averaged together to improve the precision of the result there is a setting to change the number of calibration points note that this is not related to the number of trackers instead it defines how many positions are going to be captured to average your alignment from using automatic calibration put on your vr headset make sure the sensor can track you properly and your head is tracked click on begin calibration two countdowns will happen for each position first you will be given time to move to a new spot and then get into position then the second countdown gives you time to stay still for the capture you must face the sensor during all position captures finally that position is captured once all positions are done calibration is complete if automatic calibration fails try again tracking glitches can cause the captured position to be off from where it should be increasing the number of points is helpful to avoid those problems manual calibration this mode involves lining up the tracking space of amethyst manually using vr controls those controls are shown in the app though they won't match if you change them via the steamvr bindings menu whenever available automatic calibration will yield better results in a proper setup manual calibration is prone to human error and should only be used when necessary using manual calibration when using vive wand controllers and index knuckle controllers the grip and trigger controls' roles are swapped to make fine tuning and confirming easier put on your vr headset and grab your controllers without any game running click on manual in the calibration mode screen take note of the controls then close the steamvr dashboard by clicking outside of it you should see nothing but the empty void with the circles on the ground i recommend first placing the trackers slightly to your right to adjust that rotation don't forget holding the left grip button will slow down your move rotate controls so you can make fine adjustments after lining up the trackers to your body take a step forward and check if they still line up if they don't adjust the left joystick rotation until they do again and they should still be good when walking back once you're happy with the calibration hold both triggers to confirm and

tracking the difference between a well configured kinect setup and one that was plonked down without much thought is pretty big there are a number of things you should take into consideration if you wish to get the most out of kinect room size and cleanliness kinect placement clothing material avoiding sunlight and other infrared interference not using lens adapters playing into the kinect's strengths using overrides to augment tracking room size and cleanliness as shown in the page about getting a kinect and adapter there is a non negligible minimum distance required for tracking to work at all and for tracking to work best xbox 360 kinect recommended 9ft 3m minimum 6ft 2m xbox one kinect recommended 7ft 2 6m minimum 5ft 1 7m as a general rule of thumb your entire body should be visible in the amethyst tracking preview as well clearing out your space of any furniture or objects that could obscure the depth of the kinect will help with tracking kinect placement as an extension of room size placing your kinect properly in relation to both the room and how tall you are is just as important if the kinect is too low the tracking quality will go down too high and it will also lower quality you should aim for around shoulder to eye level with an angle and distance that allows the kinect to see you from head to toe and see the floor avoid very steep angles anything past 21 degree is going to reduce the tracking quality by a lot clothing material the color of your clothes doesn't matter but the type of fabric and the shape does wearing baggy clothes like loose sweatpants dresses or skirts will obscure the actual shape of your body making it harder for the kinect to track as well consider the way that the kinect tracks the fabric your clothes are made of should not only be reflective to infrared but also reflect it clearly think of clear versus frosted glass both of them reflect light but the frosted glass refracts the light bouncing onto it into a blurry mess the kinect needs to send a precise pattern of dotted light that it then scans with an infrared camera if that pattern isn't properly reflected then that depth is either completely discarded or has to be guessed avoid sunlight while kinect is imperviable to most types of lighting be it incandescent neon or led lights the sun emits a lot of infrared light which when mixed with the kinect's need to see it's own infrared structured light causes issues try putting closing blinds or moving the kinect so it does not face directly into a window do not use lens adapters such as nyko zoom while it is understandable that one would wish to increase the tracking volume of the xbox 360 kinect with an aftermarket lens accessory these gizmos gadgets doohickeys use fisheye lenses which cause the structured light and the view of the camera to become heavily distorted while it may have worked for games such as just dance which did not use skeleton tracking instead merely matching the body shape in the depth map to what it expected the player to do it won't work for games that require skeleton tracking either the skeleton tracking system will never pick you up or your movements will be very distorted in 3d space also microsoft themselves warned against using it ignore the comments from the morons that had no idea how kinect works play into the kinect's strengths the tracking sdk was made specifically to run very fast on very little power 10 of an xbox 360 as such many concessions were made for example during the development of the skeleton tracking system only poses that were deemed useful for gaming were kept in the training dataset the tracking sdk assumes the player's head to be up and that the player is facing forward it's not that the sdk cannot understand the difference between front and back it's that it was artificially limited to increase stability in a computationally cheap manner understanding this you can temper your expectations on tracking in situations where the sdk wasn't trained and you can try to avoid these so people don't point at you and laugh haha you kinect loser buy vive pucks just print money idiot using overrides to augment tracking considering the often lackluster joint rotation on the kinect sdk you can use ps move controllers or phones with owotrack to replace the rotation of one or more joints from the skeleton with more accurate data

controllers for your feet while still using the kinect's skeleton tracking for the position note for example when using ps moves for foot rotation like this the center of rotation of the controller is not going to match where the joint from the kinect is so you'll most likely want to use offsets in the general page to adjust the position until it matches more closely or else you'll have weird displacement when turning when an override runs into an error the base device will still be affected which means that in our ps move feet example your feet would lose all rotation until the device is

note that this was recorded before the vrchat ik 2 0 update how does it work augmented hip uses inverse kinematics to simulate what your body would do in real time this allows for a responsive and mostly accurate hip tracker with minimal computational overhead is augmented hip better than owotrack or a vive tracker the primary advantage augmented hip has over other trackers is the fact that it is purely virtual as a result of this it doesn't need a battery to operate as long as your vr headset and feet are tracking well augmented hip will also track well is augmented hip better than a

adapter","path":"en/buying-kinect","plaintext":"getting a kinect and adapter when using amethyst you're most likely going to use a kinect other devices are supported but 99 of users are interested in using the app for kinect body tracking if you came here it's because you don't already have a kinect and want to know where and what to buy there's a few recommendations and some huge do nots that you should follow it's easy to end up overpaying or buying broken hardware should you even get a kinect there's other options out there slimevr apriltag vive trackers obviously ps move too kinect is cheap but it has limitations that might make you want to reconsider sideways tracking is almost inexistent any poses that involve your head being lower than your waist e g handstands breakdancing cartwheels backflips can't be done joint rotation is far from perfect unless you provide external data from compatible devices and most of all you need a really large room with xbox 360 kinect you need to stand at least 1 5 meters away from it for tracking to work and preferably 2 meters for the best tracking with xbox one kinect it's more around 1 2 meters minimum and 1 8 preferably you also need to put the kinect where it can see you at eye level and connect to your pc the cable is about 3 meters 9 feet and the adapter adds another 30cm 1 foot and if that wasn't funny enough the kinect especially the xbox one kinect is very demanding when it comes to usb bandwidth generally if you have an amd ryzen computer you're almost guaranteed to be fine laptops and quest 2 with oculus link are notable things that can cause issues if you're unsure i would recommend joining the discord and asking us for advice there which kinect should you get in most cases the answer will be to get an xbox 360 kinect for reasons detailed on this page the xbox one kinect costs a lot more over the xbox 360 and apart from a larger field of view smaller minimum required distance for tracking and a 1080p color camera it doesn't actually track you any better or faster than the xbox 360 kinect it also suffers from a lot of issues with usb 3 0 bandwidth and chipset compatibility and breaks tracking on headsets and controllers using base stations e g vive index pimax if you have a smaller room and can only stand about 1 5 meters away and you've ensured that you have the usb bandwidth to run the xbox one kinect then you might consider it but otherwise just don't where do i buy the kinect if you're in the uk go here don't even ask any questions kinects sold at cex always work the adapters are tested and there's a warranty it's price is also unbeatable it also means you get to ignore the entire part about adapters further down this page elsewhere check either ebay or local classified ads websites any kinect you'll find on amazon is probably overpriced if you search for common mispellings of kinect like xbox connect konect kinnect or similar you'll often find listings from people that lack education on both spelling and money where do i get the adapter get it on ebay please after doing years of suport on the k2vr comunity discord we found that every user who got shipped a dead adapter had purchased it through amazon i know that some people may be reticent to use ebay because of past experiences but we've had only good feedback from people using ebay on our discord depending on where you live the link for ebay will change but just open the homepage and search kinect 360 adapter and pick the first or second listing whichever has cheaper shipping or if you wanna get it faster buy it from a seller in your country if you don't have ebay you can check local stores classified ads or local ebay like websites e g mercari marketplaats facebook marketplace craigslist e t c once the stuff arrives go to either setting up your xbox 360 kinect or setting up your xbox one kinect depending on the kinect you got"},{"title":"How Amethyst compares to other

support bot commands and everything else surrounding the app is still being made and things change constantly and can break at any time recommending amethyst right now at least without making these things very clear is like suggesting someone install a leaked beta build of windows as their daily driver os considerations when making videos we understand the usefulness of video as a medium for conveying information it's perfect for those who prefer a visual approach to learning things and it can allow you to explain complicated concepts more succinctly that being said videos due to their nature are often hard to update especially on platforms like youtube where one might make a tutorial to help others but also for their own gain in views money or notoriety so video creators are often incentivized to leave their evergreen content up instead of replacing the video or unlisting it then making another one when the old video has gone out of fashion the term refers to videos that go past the youtube recommendation algorithm and get a consistent amount of views for the lifetime of the video instead of plateau ing after a few weeks these videos are sought out by creators because they're a guaranteed source of constant ad revenue on top of their other videos there are a few things you can follow and keep in mind to make tutorial videos the best they can be be clear and concise in our own documentation and getting started pages we made every page so it could be skimmed over only reading text in bold warnings and lists and still provide all the important information to the user this methodology translates to video as well you don't need to spend 2 minutes explaining what a kinect does people already know that why do you think they clicked on the video don't kid yourself finding a new shiny piece of tech can put rose tinted glasses on you and you'll want to tell everyone about how cool and awesome it is with good reason but if you're going to make an informative video you have to take the glasses off and look at the bigger picture see the flaws in things the problems that can arise because hiding any of the issues to users would just lead to them developing distrust in the software or in you when something breaks timeliness is key videos are stuck in time but that doesn't mean they can't be aware of it make a call out to the official website or even simply to the fact the video could be outdated in the future people can continue watching your video but that way users will know to be careful and double check info elsewhere leading to less issues and better satisfaction with your 3 year old video because you had a really good explanation of the calibration process that clicked with people anecdotal evidence does not make a tutorial if you find some arcane steps to fix some obscure issue you had that wasn't shown anywhere else try reproducing the problem and the fix first researching into why the fix works and possibly asking us over on discord we've seen a lot of weird stuff over the years nothing sucks more than finding a tutorial about a random obscure bug only to find out that the fix only works for the setup of the person who made the video what should you cover amethyst is beta software this app is still in active development the installation method the supported configs app layout and everything else is subject to change even after release future updates may bring large changes kinect is not for everyone while kinect is awesome for it's price some people just want vive trackers and you gotta tell them the truth about kinect it's not perfect sideways tracking breaks down after a few seconds sitting down works fine only under proper tracking conditions users need a large room otherwise tracking quality will take a hit foot rotation is doable but when using nothing but the kinect it won't do miracles any poses where the head is lower than the waist e g handstands are impossible laying down is possible but only in perfect conditions and given you use the tracker freeze feature read the docs we wrote them for you unless a team member says otherwise treat the docs as the most accurate information you can find on the matter we put a lot of work into covering every possible topic please feel free to use the search feature if you're unsure about something you wish to put in a video don't hesitate to ask us on discord xbox 360 kinect > xbox one kinect newer is not always better and it couldn't be more true than with the xbox one kinect between incompatibility with lighthouse devices even stricter and higher usb controller requirements and an unfixable hardware flaw that causes the foot rotation to jitter back and forth it's really not a good option for anyone compared to xbox 360 kinect you can find more info on this page about the matter avoid amazon when purchasing adapters statistics from our discord server show that nearly every adapter that has been dead on arrival or died later on was purchased from amazon with kinect 360 third party adapters are fine as long as they're not from amazon with kinect one you need to ensure it has a signal repeater and the cables aren't bad and that it says microsoft on it and generally getting a 360 kinect and an adapter for it costs less than a good quality xbox one adapter users need a very large playspace as shown on the improve tracking page the difference between a room that is too small for kinect and one that lets you stand a few meters away is huge it goes from unuseable garbage to fooling people into thinking it's vive pucks as a general rule of thumb tracking starts at about 6ft 2m and isn't very good until 8 9ft 3m as well the user needs to be able to place the kinect around chest to eye level putting it very low or on the floor will yield worse results equally putting it too high will also result in bad tracking quality some usb controllers are not compatible at all usb controllers are the actual chipset mini cpu things on your motherboard or laptop logic board that take care of handling the in out data from usb devices these controllers are made by multiple manufacturers and certain models are not made very well and driver updates can't fix them here's a list of very bad ones asmedia 3 0 controllers via 3 0 controllers pre ryzen amd 3 0 controllers fresco logic 3 0 controllers these should be avoided you can see what host controllers you have in device manager under the universal serial bus controllers section point users to the website not github or our discord the website is made to cover everything the user may need to know about amethyst and it's supported devices and apps and it will point the user towards the installer download avoid using direct github links because then we need to put warnings on every corner to ensure users are always getting the latest info the main homepage and onboarding experience of k2vr tech is being updated it will go live once amethyst goes out of technical preview run the installer follow the on screen instructions the installer is built to be easy to use and understand you should not have to explain how it works to the user amethyst installer is currently in development a preliminary version will be offered to users who wish to test it soon and a more complete version will release alongside amethyst when it goes out of technical preview users will run into problems assume that only 1 in 100 users will have a flawless setup experience it's very common for the kinect sdk to randomly break for a multitude of reasons or for other problems to happen there are a lot of moving parts to the kinect full body setup after all and most importantly remind users to tell us that they came from your video if they come to our discord server this will help us in knowing exactly what instructions were given to them and what they could've misunderstood causing the error they're having in conclusion i'm sorry that this seems rather draconian you can ignore half of these things but if you make a video that gets popular and has a lot of wrong info in it causing misinformation to be spread you're gonna hear from us happy video making"},{"title":"Common issues with Xbox One Kinect","path":"en/one/common-issues","plaintext":"common issues with xbox one kinect this page is aimed at users wishing to buy a kinect or have an xbox one kinect but no adapter unless you use a headset and or controllers that use base stations you can make it work even if it won't be as good as with the xbox 360 kinect this page is about using xbox one kinect for full body tracking in virtual reality if you were linked here from elsewhere on the internet not all of this info will apply but it's still important to keep in mind newer is not always better after a few years of doing support on kinecttovr k2ex and now amethyst we've found that xbox one kinect is more trouble than it's worth here's all the reasons tracking quality is same as xbox 360 kinect the kinect for windows sdk v2 0 for xbox one kinect uses the same body tracking algorithms internally as the sdk v1 8 for xbox 360 kinect it had different training data but the same limitations were imposed on it for performance reasons every pose that the xbox 360 kinect cannot do the xbox one kinect cannot either incompatibility with base station devices devices that use base stations for tracking like vive index tundra or pimax headsets trackers and controllers are incompatible with xbox one kinect the time of flight sensor on the xbox one kinect confuses these devices into thinking an invalid base station is present and thus blocks them from tracking either completely or in large blind spots foot rotation as of amethyst 1 1 0 0 a new rotation mode was added specifically to alleviate the foot rotation issues it's called leg based orientation you can find it in settings > tracker configuration > feet trackers > orientation tracking > leg based orientation the behavior is similar to xbox 360 kinect's default rotation mode but the feet mostly face forward there is an unfixable hardware flaw of the xbox one kinect that makes it create a fog near the floor because of the way the infrared bounces are modulated on the sensor as long as your feet are inside the fog foot rotation will jitter back and forth continuously using the software calculated rotation option in amethyst's tracker configuration screen will help but cannot solve the issue entirely usb bandwidth and host controller compatiblity the xbox one kinect is a usb 3 0 device and requires nearly the entire sustained 5gbps bandwidth that usb 3 0 can provide not all usb controllers are made equal and some either have issues with bandwidth heavy devices or simply do not work you can check what usb host controllers you have by opening device manager then expanding the universal serial bus controllers section all the devices labelled something something host controller here's a list of usb host controllers that work renesas usb 3 0 amd usb 3 1 amd usb 3 2 intel usb 3 1 intel usb 3 2 asmedia usb 3 1 and a list of controllers that don't work via usb 3 0 asmedia usb 3 0 amd usb 3 0 non ryzen fresco logic usb 3 0 the temperature sensor is a ticking time bomb inside the xbox one kinect is a temperature sensor to ensure that the kinect acn shut down in the event that the fan fails or the ventilation gets obstructed this temperature sensor uses analog components and it tends to go bad on a lot of xbox one kinect sensors once it does the kinect will reboot in a loop until you manually fix the issue by cutting the wires going to it inside the device adapters are expensive and prone to breaking unlike with xbox 360 kinect third party adapters aren't a sure fire win every time many factors come into play to make a good xbox one kinect adapter the ameperage required is higher than xbox 360 kinect the cables need to do usb 3 0 and the main box needs to have a signal repeater inside to ensure the usb 3 0 signal isn't degraded as it goes through the entire length of the cable most third party adapters do not do this nor were they ever actually tested instead you end up with 20 dollar e waste 40 dollar adapter gambling or 70 dollar microsoft money wasting in most countries an xbox 360 kinect and a third party adapter can be had for less than the bad xbox one kinect adapters considering this there is no reason to get an adapter if you already have an xbox one kinect just get an xbox 360 kinect instead the sdk provides no clear errors to the user unlike the numerous admittedly non descriptive at first glance errors of the xbox 360 kinect's v1 8 sdk the v2 0 sdk has two states it works or it doesn't leaving you the user to figure out why things broke from trial and error it costs too much while it isn't hard to find an xbox one kinect for pretty cheap nobody wants them that doesn't stop the fact that getting a good adapter and possibly a usb 3 0 pcie card to actually get the thing working on your computer gets expensive fast compared to xbox 360 kinect in conclusion if all you wanna do is play just dance or do 3d scanning go ahead but expect jank"},{"title":"Setting up your Xbox One

update driver instead of the older manually installed sdk you can see instructions on doing that on this page placement the kinect one has a very high vertical field of view this means you can be more lenient in where you place it we recommend having it at around chest height facing perfectly straight in general avoid pointing it down at the floor the infrared bouncing back is what causes your feet to become mostly invisible and breaks foot rotation calibration once you've done this put on your vr headset and get the trackers calibrated"},{"title":"Xbox One Kinect troubleshooting","path":"en/one/troubleshooting","plaintext":"xbox one kinect troubleshooting figuring out what is going wrong with the xbox one kinect isn't as easy as with 360 because the sdk doesn't provide errors beside a generic sensor is unavailable you have to look for other signs in usb devices drivers and such hopefully this page helps you fix your problem hardware first and foremost you should ensure everything hardware wise is in order there's no point in trying to diagnose issues if a cable is loose or you don't have the kinect plugged into a compatible usb controller check your cables ensure that every connection from the kinect mains power and adapter is connected firmly and that your cables aren't damaged sometimes a usb 3 cable that is too long from the adapter to the computer can cause issues too usb controllers the xbox one kinect is incompatible with these usb controllers any usb 2 0 controller asmedia 3 0 fresco logic via it's recommended that you have one of these renesas nec 3 0 amd 3 1 or above ryzen cpus intel 3 1 or above asmedia 3 1 in the case where you have none of the above on a desktop with an available pcie slot you can purchase a usb add in card with a renesas controller by searching for usb pcie renesas on amazon or other online stores if you're on a laptop and you don't have intel 3 1 or ryzen why are you even trying to use vr drivers unlike with k2ex we now recommend that you use the newer drivers that are distributed through windows update for the kinect v2 the old drivers are version v2 0 1409 and include an sdk for developers the new drivers are version v2 2 1905 and only include the required runtime if your kinect appears as a webcam in apps like discord then you're already using the newer driver if you installed the sdk manually you can just leave it there and update only the kinect driver open device manager expand the kinect sensor devices category right click the kinect device click on update driver choose search automatically for drivers let windows update do it's magical thing obviously this requires windows update being functional other issues here's a few other things that could have gone wrong faulty adapter it's common for kinect v2 adapters to be hit or miss check that all the cables are firmly plugged in and that the adapter is receiving power on the official one the light should be orange it's also possible with cheap adapters that the signal is being degraded either through cheap wiring or cables that are too long it's not like they actually test it low framerate low framerates are usually caused by there being other devices on the same usb controller taking just enough bandwidth that the kinect can still start but can't send it's full data through basically try unplugging everything usb near the kinect temperature sensor inside the kinect is a fan and a temperature sensor attached to that fan because it's an analog part it can go bad over time and report very high temperatures in error you need to open the kinect up with a torx t2 screwdriver then cut the yellow and blue wires and put some electrical tape to cover them up this will disable the temperature sensor here's a video showing how to do it foot rotation the default rotation mode for xbox one kinect allows you to turn your feet freely the problem is that in 99 of cases your floor and everything near it are invisible to the kinect because only your legs are visible to the kinect in amethyst you should switch the orientation tracking mode for the feet trackers to leg based orientation it's not perfect but will fix the issue"},{"title":"Setting up the Amethyst OSC plugin for Quest","path":"en/osc","plaintext":"setting up the amethyst osc plugin for quest before you go any further please join our discord at https discord gg ybqcrdg every step on this page is important many of them will be made obselete when amethyst gets native osc support but transitioning from the plugin to the native version will be very simple hi everyone from the vrchat developer update we're hard at work on a semi rewrite of amethyst to simplify future development once that's done getting osc out the door will be easier preface in late november 2022 vrchat released an open beta including a feature called osc trackers what this feature allows is for any application to send data over the network using osc to vrchat with information about the position and rotation for 1 to 8 trackers and then allow the user to calibrate with them for full body tracking until now vrchat only supported vive trackers directly in steamvr and applications that emulated those like amethyst or slimevr we have created a plugin for amethyst to send the enabled trackers over osc told you that whole modular and extensible thing would come in useful pre requisites amethyst is for kinect tracking mostly we do not have support for 2d cameras and most likely never will as long as your computer runs an up to date version of windows 10 or 11 and was built in the last decade you're most likely good to go we recommend taking a look at the usb controllers section in amethyst installer you should have at least one compatible controller to have a good experience as well you need to have some kind of compatible hardware like xbox 360 kinect xbox one kinect or a complete playstation move ps3 eye setup in psmoveserviceex part 1 wi fi is not internet the speed of your internet connection what allows you to visit websites and play online games does not matter in fact you could have the old 90s dial up internet with the funny modem sounds and it wouldn't matter because osc goes over the network you need to make sure your quest is connected to the same local network as your pc this part only really applies if you have two wi fi routers you would probably know if you have two of those if your pc is connected to the router with a cable then make sure the quest is connected to the wi fi network that router is on if you're using a wi fi adapter on your pc or using a laptop make sure the pc and the quest are on the same wi fi network this isn't garanteed to work but sometimes you will have separate wi fi networks for the 2 4ghz and 5ghz bands and some routers will only show devices on the 2 4ghz network to devices connected with a cable so try connecting to the 2 4ghz wi fi specifically if they are separate though 5ghz is preferable open the quest's universal menu click on quick settings on the left side quick settings in the quest main menu click on wi fi wi fi in the quest quick settings connect to the desired network if it isn't already click the network itself once it's successfully connected scroll down to advanced then click on that scroll further down until you see ip address i would add more images but they come out blank why facebook this is what other devices in your house see the quest as and you will need to enter it in amethyst so keep note of it part 2 enabling osc in vrchat launch vrchat on the quest open the action menu the round one by pressing and holding one of the quick menu buttons go to options then osc and toggle on enabled enabling osc it's easy to forget this step and then spend 20 minutes why it's not working so make sure to do it now instead of later you are now ready to receive osc tracker data part 3 installing amethyst and the plugin before installing amethyst you must have steamvr installed you do not need to connect a headset to steamvr but it must be present to install and run amethyst this will not be the case once native osc support is released assuming you have steam on your computer you can install steamvr using this button install steamvr from steam once steamvr is installed run it at least once even without a headset you can now install amethyst using this button download latest amethyst installer version installing the osc plugin i understand that the plugin is janky and experimental i accept the tracker alignment is imperfect because of plugin limitations i understand that osc trackers in their native implementation will be much better i have read all of the above if so here's the download link download the amethyst osc plugin once you've download the plugin zip you need to extract it to amethyst's install folder open the amethyst install folder dragging the osc zip into the correct folder enabling the null steamvr driver so amethyst can start download and run this automatically enable the steamvr null headset driver here's the source code if you care press y then enter press enter again to finish and exit you can enable it manually by following the instructions on this github page you're just editing two json files we just believed it would be easier for people to run a small exe but it barely works because steamvr is a royal pain can't wait for native osc null driver tool after that's done steamvr should look like this steamvr null driver in steamvr go to settings steamvr open settings then click on startup shutdown then manage add ons steamvr openvrpaths window finally click on the on off toggle next to no hmd and then click on restart steamvr restart steamvr

development has become a chore as such akaya is rewriting it and the plugins in c net for easier development work on this is going along pretty well but it is stopping further development on other features native osc we released a rather janky plugin for using amethyst for vrchat's osc trackers feature because it's a plugin there are a ton of limitations in tracking quality and features once amethyst net is ready native osc support will be implemented and should be hopefully available by the next release official release this isn't quite development related but the current state of amethyst is in a soft release we want to come out with a bang once everything is ready after native osc we're talking release trailer social media announcements finally taking off the preview tag getting out of beta and releasing on time as one might say semi far future the stuff here is in the planning and can we even do this is this worth it stages none of these are guaranteed to be arriving to amethyst ai based kinect tracking 99 of the kinect's limitations are due to it using a proprietary skeleton tracking sdk created by microsoft research in the mid 2000s they were using what was considered state of the art in machine learning at the time but even then also had to make sure it ran on 10 of an xbox 360 so they made a ton of concessions limited the training dataset to poses they deemed useful for xbox games and imposed hardcoded limitations like the kinect always facing forward we wish to take the kinect's depth map and create our own pose estimation neural network with the help of the community to gather a large dataset this is very still in the planning stages but we're really hopeful we can pull it off amethyst on linux this one is a maybe with amethyst net the ui and the logic are being decoupled meaning that in theory amethyst could run as a net core app on linux with it's ui in uno platform the kinect plugin would not have skeleton tracking unless we've got ai tracking working by then psmove couldn't work psmsex is windows only so you'd be left with owotrack and maybe an openhmd plugin to use a rift as trackers the technical aspect is very feasible but it's

k2ex ha existido akaya llevaba trabajando en una versión ya abandonada de la aplicación usando qt como proyecto aparte con la intención de que eventualmente reemplazara a la aplicación principal mucho del trabajo de esta nueva versión no fue en vano de él fué creada la k2api que proporciona las interfaces necesitadas para que cualquier aplicación se comunique con el controlador de steamvr además de mucho de el código base para controlar kinects despues de que haya muchos problemas por parte de qt akaya lo abandonó y empezó a trabajar en una nueva revisión super secreta de ktvr usando winui 3 de microsoft para la interfaz originalmente llamada kinecttovr 1 0 fue dada el nombre en clave de amethyst se me ocurrió ese nombre en unos 30 segundos solo estaba destinado a ser un nombre en clave para referirnos a la aplicación internamente sin que nos confundieramos eventualmente me dí cuenta que considerando el salto pequeño en número de version solo de 0 9 a 1 0 los usuarios tál vez no se darían cuenta de que es una aplicación completamente nueva y así el nombre amethyst fue asignado al proyecto winui 3 entero a su vez fue dado una nueva capa de pintura en el logo puntos tambíen resulta que la gente no escribe mal tanto amethyst como lo hacían con kinecttovr donde nos encontramos ahora ahora la aplicación se llama amethyst y esta creada por el equipo k2vr team el soporte se da en el servidor de discord k2vr community la aplicación y su documentación se encuentran en la página web k2vr tech y la aplicación usada para instalar amethyst se llama amethyst installer asi que en resumen cuando hablas sobre la aplicación amethyst cuando hablas sobre el proyecto k2vr quién es esa chica esa es violet la mascota de k2vr y amethyst ya que amethyst es una aplicación de seguimiento de cuerpo tenía sentido que nosotros tengamos una mascota para ayudar a crear demonstraciónes del seguimiento en una forma que sea consistente con el resto de nuestra marca puedes verla haciendo unos trucos impresionantes en la página principal de la página web saludándote en el instalador de amethyst y en el asistente de configuración la primera vez que abres la app también esta en la ventana de calibración para mostrarte una guía visual de como moverte por tu aréa de juego también es nuestro robot de soporte en discord por qué desarrollar seguimiento con kinect no es una tecnología muerta entiendo porqué alguien pensaría eso pero la realidad es que sobre los años con diferentes ideas innovaciones etc hemos podido sacar mucho partido de este hardware envejecido le da a mucho silicio existente una nueva vida y hace a personas felices no voy a ocultar que a veces duele tener que tratar con los controladores antiguos para el kinect tienen muchos bugs y son la fuente de los problemas de muchos de nuestros usuarios pero cuando la gente entra en el servidor de discord y nos cuenta la diversión que han pasado con su kinect hace que merezca la pena tener seguimiento de cuerpo en rv es una de las experiencias mas inmersivas y podemos ofrecerlo gratis o casi gratis a cualquier persona el kinect ya es mucho mejor de lo que debería ser un sensor de 30 dólares de 2010 y todavía no hemos acabado ya que nada ha sido confirmado todavía no revelaré planes futuros pero espera por cosas muy guays de nosotros aceptaís donaciones sí aquí mismo en nuestra página opencollective puedes hacer donaciónes mensuales o de una sola vez el dinero irá a costes de alojamiento y dominio comprar hardware para que nuestros miembros de el equipo prueben cosas más rapido y compensar el trabajo voluntariado de todos que han hecho estos años los donadores serán dados un rol permanente en el servidor de discord y tendrán su nombre listado en la página de créditos de la aplicación puedes escoger no ser listado si quieres conservar el anonimato"},{"title":"Installing Amethyst","path":"es/app/installation","plaintext":"instalando amethyst"},{"title":"Getting a Kinect and adapter","path":"es/buying-kinect","plaintext":"obteniendo un kinect y su adaptador cuando uses amethyst probablemente uses un kinect soportamos otros dispositivos pero el 99 de usuarios están interesados en usar la aplicación para seguimiento con kinect si has venido hasta aquí es porque todavía no tienes un kinect y quieres saber qué comprar y donde hacerlo hay algunas recomendaciones y advertencias que deberías seguir es fácil acabar pagando demasiado o comprando hardware que no funcione deberías comprar un kinect hay algunas otras opciones como slimevr apriltag rastreadores vive o ps move los kinects son baratos pero tienen algunos límites que tal vez te hagan reconsiderar el seguimiento de lado es casi inexistente cualquier pose que haga que tu cabeza este debajo de tu cintura como hacer el pino breakdance volteretas etc no se pueden hacer la rotación de articulaciones está lejos de ser perfecta a no ser que proporciones datos externos de dispositivos compatibles lo más importante necesitas un área grande con el kinect de xbox 360 necesitas estar a por lo menos 1 5 metros para que funcione el seguimiento y preferiblemente a 2 metros para el mejor seguimiento con el kinect de xbox one es más bien 1 2 metros mínimo y 1 8 metros preferiblemente también necesitas colocar el kinect donde te pueda ver a nivel de ojo y conectarlo a tu pc el cable es de unos 3 metros 9 pies y el adaptador añade otros 30 centímetros 1 pie y si eso no fuera lo gracioso suficiente el kinect especialmente el de xbox one necesita mucho ancho de banda usb generalmente si tienes un ordenador con amd ryzen es lo más probable que te funcione los portatíles y quest 2 con oculus link son dos cosas notables que pueden causar problemas si no estás seguro únete al discord y pregúntanos allí que kinect deberías comprar en la mayoría de casos la respuesta será comprar un kinect de xbox 360 por razónes detalladas en esta página el kinect de xbox one cuesta bastante mas que el de xbox 360 y aparte de un campo de visión mayor distancia minima requerida más baja y una cámara color 1080p no hace seguimiento mejor o más rapido que el kinect de xbox 360 también sufre de muchos problemas con usb 3 ancho de banda compatibilidad con diferentes chipsets y rompe el seguimiento con cascos y mandos que usen estaciones base ej vive index pimax si tienes un área mas pequeña y solo puedes colocarte a unos 1 5 metros y estás seguro de que tienes el ancho de banda usb para correr un kinect de xbox one entonces tal vez considéralo pero si no no lo hagas dónde compro el kinect si estás en españa península y islas canarias méxico portugal italia países bajos polonia australia o irlanda vete aquí ni siquiera preguntes los kinects vendidos en cex siempre funcionan los adaptadores son comprobados y hay garantía su precio también es imbatible también significa que puedes ignorar la parte entera sobre adaptadores más abajo en esta página si no mira en ebay o páginas de compra venta locales cualquier kinect que veas en amazon probablemente cueste demasiado si buscas por erratas comunes de kinect como xbox connect konect kinnect o similares muchas veces encontrarás listados de gente que le falta educación en el dinero y en cómo escribir dónde compro el adaptador comprálo en ebay por favor tenemos con buenas pruebas que a todos los usuarios que les llegó un adaptador que no funciona lo compraron en amazon sé que a algunas personas no les gusta usar ebay por experiencias pasadas pero sólo hemos tenido buenas reacciones de gente que uso ebay en nuestro servidor de discord dependiendo de donde vivas el link a ebay cambiará pero sólo abre la página principal y busca adaptador kinect 360 o en inglés kinect 360 adapter y escoge el primer o segundo resultado cual tenga envio mas barato o si quieres recibirlo más rápido cómpralo de un vendedor que se localice en tu país cuando lleguen las cosas vete a una de las siguientes páginas según que kinect tengas configurando
