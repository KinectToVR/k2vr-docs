supported but 99 of users are interested in using the app for kinect body tracking if you came here it's because you don't already have a kinect and want to know where and what to buy there's a few recommendations and some huge do nots that you should follow it's easy to end up overpaying or buying broken hardware should you even get a kinect there's other options out there slimevr apriltag vive trackers obviously ps move too kinect is cheap but it has limitations that might make you want to reconsider sideways tracking is almost inexistent any poses that involve your head being lower than your waist e g handstands breakdancing carthweels backflips can't be done joint rotation is far from perfect nuless you provide external data from comaptible devices and most of all you need a really large room with xbox 360 kinect you need to stand at least 1 5 meters away from it for tracking to work and preferably 2 meters for the best tracking with xbox one kinect it's more around 1 2 meters minimum and 1 8 preferably you also need to put the kinect where it can see you at eye level and connect to your pc the cable is about 3 meters 9 feet and the adapter adds another 30cm 1 foot and if that wasn't funny enough the kinect especially the xbox one kinect is very demanding when it comes to usb bandwidth generally if you have an amd ryzen computer you're almost guaranteed to be fine laptops and quest 2 with oculus link are notable things that can cause issues if you're unsure i would recommend joining the discord and asking us for advice there which kinect should you get in most cases the answer will be to get an xbox 360 kinect for reasons detailed on this page the xbox one kinect costs a lot more over the xbox 360 and apart from a larger field of view smaller minimum required distance for tracking and a 1080p color camera it doesn't actually track you any better or faster than the xbox 360 kinect it also suffers from a lot of issues with usb 3 0 bandwidth and chipset compatibility and breaks tracking on headsets and controllers using base stations e g vive index pimax if you have a smaller room and can only stand about 1 5 meters away and you've ensured that you have the usb bandwidth to run the xbox one kinect then you might consider it but otherwise just don't where do i buy the kinect if you're in the uk go here don't even ask any questions kinects sold at cex always work the adapters are tested and there's a warranty it's price is also unbeatable it also means you get to ignore the entire part about adapters further down this page elsewhere check either ebay or local classified ads websites any kinect you'll find on amazon is probably overpriced if you search for common mispellings of kinect like xbox connect konect kinnect or similar you'll often find listings from people that lack education on both spelling and money where do i get the adapter get it on ebay please we have it on good authority that every user who got shipped a dead adapter had purchased it on amazon i know that some people may be reticent to use ebay because of past experiences but we've had only good feedback from people using ebay on our discord depending on where you live the link for ebay will change but just open the homepage and search kinect 360 adapter and pick the first or second listing whichever has cheaper shipping or if you wanna get it faster buy it from a seller in your country once the stuff arrives go to either setting up your xbox 360 kinect or setting up your xbox one kinect depending on the kinect you got"},{"title":"How Amethyst compares to other options","path":"en/comparison","plaintext":"how amethyst compares to other options hurr durr cool comparison shit idk dont have stuff for it
