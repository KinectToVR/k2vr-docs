# What is owoTrack?

owoTrack is an open source app, originally created by GlobalIndustrial, to use any compatible phone as a waist tracker by using the phone's onboard sensors.

### Is using owoTrack worth it?

Yes!

> **TODO:** \*insert owoTrack demonstration video here\*

### Can I use a smartwatch?

If it supports WearOS, yes! You can check if it supports WearOS by going [here](https://wearos.google.com).

### Can I use multiple phones?

Amethyst only supports up to one owoTrack device currently. If you wish to use multiple devices for owoTrack simultaneously, we recommend using them [PSMoveServiceEx's virtual device manager](https://github.com/Timocop/PSMoveServiceEx-Virtual-Device-Manager).
