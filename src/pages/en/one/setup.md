# Setting up your Xbox One Kinect
Unlike with the Xbox 360 Kinect, the Kinect One drivers are readily available from Windows Update. **Please use the Windows Update driver instead of the older manually installed SDK.**

You can see instructions on doing that [on this page.](/en/one/troubleshooting#5)

## Placement
The Kinect One has a very high vertical field of view. This means you can be more lenient in where you place it. **We recommend having it at around chest height facing perfectly straight.**

In general **avoid pointing it down at the floor.** The infrared bouncing back is what causes your feet to become mostly invisible and breaks foot rotation.

## Calibration
Once you've done this, [put on your VR headset and get the trackers calibrated.](/en/app/calibration)
