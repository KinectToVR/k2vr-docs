# Using standalone VR headsets with Amethyst
A trend towards wireless VR headsets that don't require being connected to a computer is emerging. Popular headsets like the Meta Quest 2, or even less popular headsets such as the Vive Focus 3 (*Does anybody own that one?*) have disrupted the market, **and we intend on supporting them when connected to a computer just like any other PC VR headset.**

These headsets almost always have one or multiple methods to connect to a computer to stream games, either from a proprietary app (e.g. Oculus Link), or third-party software such as [ALVR](https://alvr-org.github.io) or [Virtual Desktop](https://vrdesktop.net).
